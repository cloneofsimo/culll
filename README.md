# cuLLL

CUDA optimized big-integer operations for lattice reduction.

Currently WIP.


## Features

* CUDA optimized big-integer operations, including
    * 3 dimensional bigint Addition
    * 3 dimensional bigint Multiplication



## TODO
----

- [ ] FFT multiplication
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Add more documentation
- [ ] Carry-lookahead addition
- [ ] Seemingless python bindings, higher abstraction.
